To achieve gesture detection in video sequences and overlay the word "DETECTED" on the frames where the desired gesture is found, we can use computer vision techniques and deep learning models. Here's a general outline of how we can approach this task along with a brief Readme and a requirement.txt file:

1-Setup:

Ensure Python is installed (preferably Python 3.x).
Install required libraries using the provided requirement.txt file.
Ensure GPU support if deep learning models are used.
2-Approach:

Preprocess the input gesture representation (image or short video clip) for feature extraction.
Train or use a pre-trained deep learning model for gesture recognition. This could be a CNN-based model trained on a dataset containing various gestures.
Apply the trained model to each frame of the test video to detect the presence of the desired gesture.
Annotate the frames where the gesture is detected with "DETECTED" in bright green on the top right corner.
3-Implementation:

Use OpenCV or a similar library to handle video input/output and frame manipulation.
Utilize a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch for model implementation and inference.
4-Files:

gesture_detection.py: Python script containing the implementation.
requirement.txt: Text file listing required libraries and their versions.
5-Usage:

Run python gesture_detection.py --input_video test_video.mp4 --gesture_representation gesture_image.png --output_video output_video.mp4 to process the test video and generate the annotated output video.
Adjust parameters such as model architecture, confidence threshold, and annotation style as needed.
6- using streamlit for showing the working.
